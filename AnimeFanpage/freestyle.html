                <h2>1. What's Anime?</h2>
                <p>In its most basic form, anime refers to animation. Interestingly enough, the name itself isn’t an abbreviation of the English word animation. Instead, it’s how you say “animated cartoon” (written アニメ) in Japanese. To a Japanese viewer, anime is any cartoon, whether it’s made in Japan or not. Outside of Japan, however, the term anime has come to mean “animation made in Japan,” or more broadly, any animated show or movie that uses signature aspects of Japanese-style animation, like vibrant colors, dramatic panning, and characteristic facial expressions.</p>

                <h2>2. Why it's so popular?</h2>
                
                    <h3>The ability to relate on a personal level </h3>
                    <p>This one is important, especially for genres like drama, romance, psychological, slice of life. We all like a good sob story or something that makes us go “OH. I feel that way too” or “Wow. That’s so sad, I feel so bad for her”. This is the factor that adds empathy, relatability and “the feels” as the cake icing. And sometimes, you might learn a lesson or two from watching these animes.</p>

                    <h3>Endorses imagination and creativity</h3>
                    <p>A world full of possibilities in which anything is possible. Impossible does not faze the animation world. Sometimes, we all need an escape from reality. If someone can imagine it, it can be drawn and then produced for the world to see. Many animes offer this fantasy to the audience and it can very powerful especially if the plot line is well-developed.</p>
